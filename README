This is a WIP soap client for node.js. Not quite functional yet.
Focusing on a specific type of wsdl for now, with complex types.
Not really working off the spec, so I could be misinterpreting things.

Goal is to create an api like this:

// Download the wsdl, and create your functions at runtime
var c = soap.createClient( wsdl );

// Emit when we're done with instantiation from wsdl
c.on( "ready", function(){
    
    // Call a method from the wsdl, which is created at runtime
    // It will be optionally typed (using the wsdl as the basis)
    c.GetSUID({
        "userid": "jmoyers@gmail.com"
    }).on("response", function( resp ){
        console.log( "Response from server:" );
        console.log( resp );
    });
    
    // For debugging in general
    c.getFunctions( showParams );
    c.getTypes();
});

Depends on libxmljs right now which I have NOT included here.
